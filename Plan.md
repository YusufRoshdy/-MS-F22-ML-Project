# Plan
This is the plan to the alternative track for the ML course. The goal is to replace the course milestones with the project milestones.

## A1
- Setup the hardware and the environment
- Run the unoptimized versions of YOLOv5 to be a baseline for the further testing.

## Oral
- Setup a server to be able to access the model remotely
- Setup and test Yolo-Fastestv2 and Yolov7

## A2
- Use ONNX to optimize Yolov7

## Final
- Optimize memory and CPU
- Explore multiprocessing to get faster results
